Travel Site Tutorial
This is the most complex site I have ever built... 
it is composed of 30,000 source files and uses 2017 best practices..
Automation with gulp, script minification, sprites, lazy loading,
it uses about 20 or so npm modules, the website litterally builds it self when
ever you make a mistake you can easily go back from your console and rebuild it,
it also keeps a copy on hand for you... off to the side so you dont over write it... 
The site also uses the best cross browser compatability that I have ever seen in 15+ years.
The site loads super fast under a second as a result of the technology stack. Notice it also 
utilizes HTML5/CSS3 functionality. Over all this is the most fun site I have ever built... 
give it a try if you get stuck I can help you mitigate that... it took quite a while to understand 
whats going on.. 
own BUG Report Note: When you do any build commands and the site does not
not resolve correctly... just go into the main styles css and force save this will fix the error and render your site... 
the bug seems to be due to my naming convention and the gulp module. When it writes the temp file it somehow replaces the
dash in the image file name with an underscore??? Not a big deal... you could just name that particular image without a dash
and this would solve the problem. Yet I just force save my styles.css by placing a space on the page and clicking ctrl+s. This 
properly injects css.
